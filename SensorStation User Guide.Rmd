# Before you begin

In order to connect directly to your SensorStation, you'll need 2 `USB->Ethernet Adapters` (we recommend: https://tinyurl.com/yc6llze4), and an Ethernet Cable, or a `Raspberry Pi compatible USB WiFi adapter` like this one https://store.celltracktech.com/products/wifi-usb-adapter-add-on-for-sensorstation-v2. **Make sure to have these on-hand prior to receiving your SensorStation so there is no delay in setup.**

# Note on Version 3 SensorStation

As of June 2022 we have released the 3rd version of the SensorStation. V3 SensorStations differ from V2 stations in a few important ways.

1. All come pre-equipped with a WiFi module built into the board. This means no more worrying about WiFi dongle compatibility; now it just works! 
2. There are 6 instead of 7 USB ports (one port slot was used to mount the WiFi chip mentioned above)
3. The GPS is BACK to being surface mounted to the board- so no extra GPS board like we had for the later issued V2 boards.
4. Enhanced security with new SSH login credentials. *This is super important if you are SSH'ing into your SensorStation!* 

# Note on Version 1 SensorStations vs. Version 2 SensorStations

This User Guide has been redesigned around the new (ca.2020) Version 2 SensorStation (V2) which includes an LCD display. Otherwise, Version 1 stations (ca.2019) are nearly identical to V2 stations. In cases where they differ, we have made note in the manual. If you are setting up a V1 station you may want to begin at the [QuickStart Guide in Appendix II](#V1Quickstart). If you find inconsistencies in this manual please email us at support@celltracktech.com as we will be updating the manual regularly.

If you are reading this document, then you most likely have purchased one of our Internet of Wildlife (IoW) components. Whether you're doing localized detailed studies of small mammals or songbirds, or you're setting up SensorStations as part of the global Motus Wildlife Tracking System (motus.org), or you're doing something in-between, we've got you covered, and this document is meant to help you get started quickly and painlessly. If for some reason you get stuck along the way, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly either via email (support@celltracktech.com) or through our online Help Desk here: [https://celltracktech.com/support/](https://celltracktech.com/support/).

# Participating in the Motus Wildlife Tracking System

If you are setting up your SensorStation to participate in the Motus Wildlife Tracking System (motus.org), your station can still be used with CTT Nodes. In general, we recommend Motus stations to include 4 Yagi 10-element antennas pointing in the 4 cardinal directions. A fifth Omni antenna can be installed and dedicated to detecting nodes, or one of the Yagi antennas can be used for nodes while the other three are positioned at 120 degrees for full coverage.  You may also add any number of 166MHz antennas by using a Software Defined Radio (SDR), such as a FunCube or RTL-SDR, via any of the USB ports on the SensorStation (SDRs are sold separately via third-party companies). A clear view of the horizon is preferred to get maximum range, so a height as high as possible is also advised. For more information on Motus, see [Appendix I](#appendix_1).


# SensorStation Precautions
Treat your SensorStation board like you would any other motherboard, Arduino or Raspberry Pi. All electronics, no matter how robust, can be static sensitive. Take care no metal objects touch the board while it is operating, such as antenna connectors or GSM antennas, as this could cause electrical shorts that will damage the board. It is advised to wear an anti-static bracelet when handling SensorStation.

# Setting up your CTT IoW System

CTT’s Internet of Wildlife System (IoW) is a complete radio telemetry system that consists of transmitters (radio tags), and receivers. Currently CTT produces five radio transmitters: the LifeTag^TM^, PowerTag^TM^, HybridTag^TM^, ES-200 and ES-150. 

## LifeTag

The **CTT LifeTag** is 100% solar powered, and therefore has no battery. This allows the tag to persist for many years, beeping out its unique digital ID whenever it has sunlight. For species active during the day, and for small animals for which multi-season or multi-year data are required, LifeTags are the obvious choice. The `LifeTag` coding includes a CRC value that validates detections on all `V2 SensorStations`, reducing the chance of any false detections by over 99%. 

## PowerTag

The **CTT PowerTag** is battery powered which means it can beep out its digitally coded ID 24-hours a day. The life span of a `PowerTag` is defined by the beep rate (# of beeps per minute) and battery size. For nocturnal species, `PowerTags` are the perfect fit.

## HybridTag

The **CTT HybridTag** takes the best features of our `LifeTag` and `PowerTag` and combines them into the smallest fully rechargeable radio transmitter in the world. With as little as 30-minutes of solar exposure over three days, the HybridTag will maintain its battery charge indefinitely. The `HybridTag` can be turned off and on using a small magent place on the underside of the tag. In the absence of any solar exposure, the `HybridTag` battery can power the tag for anywhere from 36 hours to over two weeks (depending on battery size). The `HybridTag` employes the same CRC validation as the `LifeTag` meaning that your detections are over 99% certain.

## ES-200 and ES-150

The **ES-200** and **ES-150** are GPS logger tags that can also send data over the 434MHz frequency, and therefore can send archived telemetry data to the `SensorStation`. Since they communicate on the same frequency as the smaller radio tags, no special radio configuration is needed. The difference between the two is that the `ES-150` also has an `Argos` radio to send data via the `Argos` satellite network.

## CTT SensorStation

The **CTT SensorStation** collect data directly from tags and can collect data from a series of `Nodes` to more precisely locate tags within a study site. The `SensorStation` stores data and, with an optional GSM data plan, can also send those data directly to the CTT and Motus servers. 

## CTT Node

**CTT Nodes** are essentially *mini-base stations*: devices with integrated solar panels, a lithium battery, and an antenna to collect data from **PowerTags**, **LifeTags** and **HybridTags**, and send those data to the **SensorStation**. These data can then be post-processed to localize tags within a grid of nodes over user-defined time steps.

## Understanding Detection Distances

The detection distance **from Node to Tag** varies for various reasons, including terrain, vegetation, and the behavior of the tagged animals. For instance, a bird flying overhead may be picked up over a kilometer away by a node, but one foraging in dense vegetation may only be detected from a few hundred meters. When using nodes for localization it's important to note that the accuracy of locations of animals wearing tags can be as little as 30m, but can range widely depending on the density of Nodes. For localizing tag positions, the spacing and placement of nodes must allow for tags to be detected simultaneously by three or more nodes.

The detection distance from **SensorStation to Node** is also affected by terrain and vegetation, but also antenna height and type (omni-directional vs. directional). **Therefore, while there is no hard and fast rule, a good starting point is to keep your farthest node within 1-1.5km of the SensorStation.** The number of SensorStations needed for each system depends on the size of the study area. For instance, in a 2 KM^2^ plot, a SensorStation placed at the center of the plot could detect nodes across the entire study area, in most cases with only an omni-directional antenna. Because `Nodes` are dependent on the SensorStation to receive their data and aggregate it for analysis, it is critical to ensure each node is within the detection radius of at least one `SensorStation` at all times. 

The detection distance from **SensorStation to Tag** is affected by the same factors as SensorStation to Node, but because many tags are on birds, bats and insects, the relationship between the two objects can change drastically over very short time steps. With line-of-sight, a tag on a bird has been shown to be detectable for **dozens of kilometers** by a SensorStation. On the other hand, birds foraging in dense vegetation may only be detectable by a station within a few kilometers. Therefore, careful consideration of station position with relation to the biological questions being asked is critical for a successful deployment.

### Mounting your Equipment

For both the SensorStation and Nodes we recommend attaching to **EMT conduit**.  We recommend this because it is rigid and easy to set up. This is *not* what’s commonly referred to as *Black Pipe* used for water and gas lines, but the **galvanized steel pipe** used for running electrical wiring inside. 

![](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/EMT.png){#id .class width=25%}

### Building a mast for your SensorStation

**We don’t recommend PVC** because it moves in the wind, becomes brittle, and will snap over time. EMT can be painted if you would like them camouflaged.

The conduit can be attached to a tripod, mounted directly into the ground, or onto a building or other structure. The Nodes and SensorStations are then attached to the conduit. The diameter of the conduit is typically 1” for the top mast section of the SensorStation (the section to which the antennas are attached; light green in the picture below).

![](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/SSinstall.png){#id .class width=25%}

For every 7 feet of height the base section will increase in diameter by ¼”. For example, in the picture above, a 15 foot mast will have a 1” section (light green) inserted into a 1 ¼” (orange) and then into a 1 ½” (blue). If the conduit is inserted into the ground, the 1 ½” conduit should be inserted into a 4’ section of 2” pipe (dark green). The pipe in the ground is cut in half, the bottom flattened slightly with sledge hammer to keep soil from entering when it is driven into the ground. A block of wood can be used to pound the pipe into the ground to prevent bending the pipe.  If the antenna mast is shorter,  the next size up gets driven into the ground (1/ ¼”). Note that standard EMT conduit does eventually rust, however it will remain very strong for 6-10 years. 

If desired, stainless conduit can be purchased, however it is much more expensive, but **recommended if you are in an area that receives high winds**. It is crucial to overlap each section of pipe by at least 2 feet. **Self tapping screws** are used to hold pipes together, but should not be used within 3-4” of the end of the pipes and/or seams. The chart below should help with what is needed for your setup per SensorStation.

| Total Approx Mast Ht.| EMT Needed for mast (10')| Ground Section Needed (4')| Coax Length Per Antenna |
| :------------------: | :----------------------: | :-----------------------: | :---------------------: |
|     7'               |    1"                    |     1 1/4"                |   min 10ft              |
|    15’               |    1”,1 ¼”               |     1 ½”                  |   min 20’               |
|    23’               |    1”, 1 ¼”, 1 ½”        |     2”                    |   min 25’               |
|    28’               |    1”, 1 ¼”, 1 ½”        |     2”- Use full 10’      |   min 30’               |

***Masts higher than 28' not recommended with standard free-standing EMT conduit. Guy wires and/or scaffold or tripod masts are other options for higher towers.***

### Mounting Nodes

Nodes are typically attached to the top of a ¾” piece of EMT. The clamps shown below come standard with the nodes and accept ¾ or 1” conduit. 

![](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/nodeClamp.jpg){#id .class width=25%}

A 7/16” socket is used to tighten the clamp bolts. The EMT is typically driven into the ground approximately 2 feet. The height of the nodes can be changed depending on the project, but for best results should be consistent within a study site. We recommend 8’ for most setups, see below for pictures of the node setup in the field. If you choose an alternate mounting method, care should be taken that they are secure. If they are mounted on anything that sways greatly with the wind, the readings won’t be consistent.

![](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/NodeBernh2.jpg){#id .class width=25%}

**Note:** ***Nodes purchased in 2020 and beyond have a built-in GPS. Prior to 2020 you must take accurate GPS readings and record that data with the Node ID in order to run post-hoc localization analyses.***


## Node Placement

Setting up the CTT Nodes is typically done in a grid in your study site. It is not imperative that they are exactly in a grid, but the closer you can set them up in a grid, the more accurate positioning you will get from the tags. In sites where this is not practical, you can simply set them up where you can, 100-300m apart, and record GPS of the Node locations. Even in a grid setup, it is best practice to take GPS coordinates whether or not they differ from the layout. Nodes should be placed above surrounding vegetation (to ensure solar recharging of the internal battery) or at least 2.5 meters above the ground.

## SensorStation Placement

If you are using Nodes, your SensorStation may be placed anywhere within range of the farthest node, which is typically 1-1.5km (although higher placement of SensorStation antennas, and clear line-of-sight between stations and nodes, can achieve longer detection distances). See the next section on SensorStation Configuration and Antenna Detail for more details on this. It is recommended to place the SensorStation antennas at least 10 meters above the ground level. The higher the antennas, the better range you will get.

![*Theoretical setup with SensorStation (diamond) in the middle of two node grids (colored circle markers). All nodes are within 1.5km of the SensorStation (black circle)*](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/SensorStationNodeSetup.png){#id .class width=25%}

## SensorStation Configuration and Antenna Detail

The standard configuration for the CTT SensorStation allows for receiving data on *five 434MHz* radio ports simultaneously. These can be configured to either record signals from LifeTags/PowerTags/HybridTags and ES-200 GPS loggers (hereafter "tags"), or to collect data from CTT Nodes. **Tags and Nodes cannot be picked up on the same channel simultaneously**, and how you configure your station depends on your study goals. The number of channels necessary on a SensorStation depends on the number of Nodes, whether you want to detect tags/transmitters and/or Nodes directly with the SensorStation, and the distance the Nodes are from the SensorStation. There is no hard limit to the number of nodes that can be detected by a single SensorStation, but it's best to keep that number around 50 or less. *Distance to the SensorStation will usually be the limiting factor for the number of nodes detectable by a single SensorStation.*

Two types of antennas are commonly used with the SensorStation: *Omnidirectional* and *Yagi*. *Omnidirectional antennas* efficiently receive energy in a *horizontal plane 360 degrees around the SensorStation*. Omnidirectional antennas typically do not have as great a range as Yagis, but a benefit is the 360 degree detection, and great detection of tags and nodes that are near the station. 

**Note: Whereas in the past we have recommended specific polarization for omnidirectional antennas picking up Nodes vs. Tags, in our testing we have found the difference negligible and find vertical omni antennas to be much simpler and less expensive for a greater value over horizontally polarized omnis.** 

*Yagis are directional antennas* used to detect tags and nodes in a specific direction from the SensorStation. They *typically have a 30-60 degree detection range that extends away from the SensorStation*. For that reason typically 2-4 antennas are used, one pointed in each cardinal direction, or two pointed in opposite directions and used to make a “fence”. Yagis can also be used to pick up Nodes that are farther away from the SensorStation.

![*This is another 434MHz-only station with four Yagi antennas for picking up tags and a single verticle omni to pick up the 50 nodes on site. The large white rectangular antenna is a 900MHz antenna used to retrieve data from a custom ES-200 GPS logger tag.*](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/WetlandsStation_NJ.png){#id .class width=25%}

While there are many antennas to choose from, these are a few that we can recommend from experience:

  * Omni-directional
    * [Data Alliance A433O5](https://www.data-alliance.net/antenna-433mhz-5dbi-omnidirectional-fiberglass-w-n-male-vhf-uhf-marine/)
      * and you'll need [this bracket](https://www.data-alliance.net/l-mount-for-antenna-pole-or-wall-mount-hole-for-n-female-or-rp-sma/) <br>
    **Make sure you choose to include the U-bolt and set screws and choose the version for Type N female connector**
      * and [this adapter](https://www.data-alliance.net/n-type-female-to-female-coupler-adapter-w-o-ring-weatherproof-bulkhead/) <br> 
    **Make sure you choose the adapter with the Type N bulkhead with O-ring!**
    
  * Yagi
    * [M2Inc 440-6SS](https://www.m2inc.com/FG4406SS)
    * [Laird YS4306](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Laird-Connectivity/YS4306?qs=EU6FO9ffTwelQ7%2FXOHiHew%3D%3D)
    * [Diamond A430S10](https://www.hamradio.com/detail.cfm?pid=H0-005816)
    * [Diamond A430S15](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/dmn-a430s15) *for specialized applications where longer-range is required
    
*__Whatever you choose, make sure you get the proper coaxial end to connect your antenna to your SensorStation!__*

![*Here is a dual-mode station in Bermuda, where four 434MHz Yagis are in the top plane, and five 166MHz Yagis are in the bottom plane. Mounting antennas in plane this way means you don't need to worry about stacking distances. This station is not listening for nodes, so all antennas are set to detect tags.*](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/BermudaDualMode.jpg){#id .class width=25%}

### Connecting antennas to your SensorStation

To connect antennas to your SensorStation you will need coaxial cable (we recommend LMR-400 or better) with the proper ends to connect to the antenna (manufacturer specific) and your SensorStation. If connecting directly to the board, each 434MHz radio has a **SMA Female** port, so your coaxial will require an **SMA Male** connector. 

If connecting to our NEMA case, your coaxial will need a **Type N Male connector**. 

If connecting an antenna for a different frequency, such as 166MHz, you will need to attach your Software Defined Radio (SDR) to one of the USB ports and your coaxial cable to the SMA connector on the SDR. Note that any 166MHz radios will only show up in the SensorGnome section of the Web Interface (see **Sensor Station Web Interface**).

### Mounting the antennas

Antennas are attached to the EMT conduit with the clamps that come with the antennas. If you have a setup that uses 4 yagis, than you will attach the yagis to a 4 or 5-way mounting “hat” you can purchase via online retailers.  Once the antennas are on EMT, attach the coax and wrap the connection with coax tape. Run down the poles to where it will attach to the SensorStation. You can use zip ties to secure the coax to poles where needed. 

![*Example of a 434MHz-only station, with four directional Yagi antennas (programmed to pick up tags), one small "horseshoe omni" (programmed to pick up the 21 nodes on site) barely visible at the very top of the antenna mast, and a little weather station broken out to the side from the top of the mast. Note the drip loop under the station box!*](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/MeadowsStation_NJ.png){#id .class width=25%}

Make sure you have enough coax to form a drip loop for each connection.

![](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/diagram_drip-loop.jpg){#id .class width="25%"}

### Siting your SensorStation
The SensorStation can be placed inside a building, or fastened to the pole or building, etc. It should either be close to the ground for easy access, or have an ethernet cable run down to an accessible location. **If placing your station inside a building be aware that this may affect GPS and/or GSM reception, possibly requiring an external antenna wired to the outside of the building.**

# Powering your SensorStation

The SensorStation can be connected directly to a 12V DC power source, via a charge controller, or to an AC to DC power supply which can then be plugged directly into your standard AC power source. In many cases, though, SensorStations are deployed remotely and are in need of a remote power supply such as a solar charged deep-cycle marine battery. A typical setup would be a 50-100W solar panel connected to a charge controller. The charge controller typically has 3 ports. The 3 ports are 1.) Solar panel 2.) 12V battery 3.) Accessory/Device/consumer, which, in this case, is your SensorStation. That line goes into the green *Power In* terminal on the SensorStation board. The positive and negative wire ports are labeled on the board, and to insert the wire simply loosen the set screws on the top, and slide the wire leads in to the holes just under the set screws (see the pictures below; note for V1 stations see the [QuickStart Guide in Appendix II](#V1Quickstart)). 

![Power not connected](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/power_out.png){#id .class width="20%"}
![Power connected](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/power_in.png){#id .class width="20%"}

The ends of the wires that are attached should be tinned with solder for best results. If you do not have access to a soldering gun, twisting the ends of the cables tightly will help them slide in cleanly to the power block. 

## Monitoring your solar voltage

If you would like to monitor your solar voltage remotely, you will need to use the solar monitor connector. it is located above the on/off switch. Simply run two wires from the solar input of the charge controller to a two pin connector.

# Powering On your SensorStation

Once connected to power, flip the black switch left of the LCD into the `PWR ON` position. You will see a number of lights begin to flash during bootup and finally the LCD screen will display a menu which you can then access via the four buttons to the right of the LCD screen.

# SensorStation LEDs

There are several LED lights on the SensorStation which may assist you in diagnosing issues. Note that with the introduction of the SensorStation V2's LCD screen, all diagnoses can be carried out via the LCD. Take a moment to review each LED.

## Diagnostic A (green)

| LED Behavior  | Meaning | Troubleshooting Steps |
| :------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------------------- |
| OFF or SOLID | The software has stopped reading data from the radios and writing to the disk. | Restart your SensorStation. |
|   Blinking | The software is reading data from the radios and writing that data to disk.  | The system is operating properly. |

## Diagnostic B (red) 

| LED Behavior  | Meaning | Troubleshooting Steps |
| :------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------------------- |
| ON| Indicates that the SensorStation has established a point-to-point protocol (PPP) connection between the network and the on-board modem. | The SensorStation checks for the connection every second. The PPP connection is just the layer that allows the modem to communicate to the network **if it is on**, but doesn't always indicate that a connection is working (such as in the case of a weak signal)  |
| OFF | Indicates that the SensorStation modem is not connected to the network.   | If there is no modem on the SensorStation this would be the typical state and behavior. If a modem exists but this behavior continues, it indicates that the modem is unable to secure a connection to the network. |

## GSM Cellular LED (blue)

The blue LED by the cellular module, labeled D9, is called the Netlight. The Netlight blinks differently, depending on the modem state. You can use this blink rate to identify if your SensorStation is connected to the Internet or unable to connect.

| LED Behavior  | Meaning | Troubleshooting Steps |
| :------------------ | :---------------------- | :----------------------- |
| OFF | The modem is not currently powered on. | Check to make sure the Raspberry Pi is running. |
| Moderate blinking (5 times per second) | The modem is searching for a signal and is not yet connected to a network.  |   Wait a minute or two for the modem to find a signal. If it continues to blink, try using an external antenna or moving the SensorStation to a better location. Also, be sure that your SensorStation has a data plan and is activated.|
|Slow blinking (once every 2 seconds) |The modem is connected to the network but is idle.| |
|Fast blinking (8 times per second) |The modem is connected to the network and is transferring data. | |

# SensorStation Navigation Buttons

The SensorStation features 4 navigation buttons labeled `UP`, `DN`, `BACK` and `SELECT`. They are typically used with the SensorStation software to navigate the LCD display.

# Downloading your data via a USB Thumb Drive

To manually download data via USB, do the following:

1. Insert a properly formatted (currently only MS DOS or Fat32 formatting is supported) USB thumb drive in one of the seven USB ports.
2. Navigate to `File Transfer > Mount USB` and press the `SELECT` button. You should see a confirmation message saying `USB Mount:success`.
3. Use the `BACK` button to go up to the `File Transfer` menu, and select `Download`. A successful download will be followed by a success message.
4. Use the `Back` button to go up to the `File Transfer` menu and select `Unmount USB`. Once you receive the success message you may remove the USB drive from the SensorStation which will now contain a copy of all the files from the station.

**Note: until February 2022 there were two known bugs in the USB manual download system. These have been rectified but any stations sold prior to February 2022 and not updated since, will require an update to realize the full functionality of the USB downoad. See the [Known Bugs](#known-bugs) section below. 

## What's in the folder?

On your USB drive you will find several files... 

  * **gps** files - these contain the GPS coordinates of the SensorStation's location
	  * `recorded at` - time/date stamp for the time the row was written to the file (UTC)
	  * `gps at` - time/date stamp for the instantaneous time of the last GPS fix (UTC)
	  * `latitude` - in decimal degrees
	  * `longitude` - in decimal degrees
	  * `altitude` - in meters
	  * `quality`
		  * `1` - No fix.
		  * `2` - 2D fix. Medium quality.
		  * `3` - 3D fix. Highest quality.
	  * `mean lat` - in decimal degrees, based on n fixes.
	  * `mean lng` - in decimal degrees, based on n fixes.
	  * `n fixes` - number of fixes used to calculate mean lat and lng. 

* **log** files
	* `msg at` - The date/time stamp of the message.
	* `msg` - The text string of the message at that time.

* **raw-data** files
	* `Time` - Date/time stamp of the data point in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
	* `RadioID` - The ID of the radio from which the data point was collected. These correspond to the Radios L1 - L5 on your SensorStation (standard 434MHz radios).
	* `TagID` - The 8-digit ID of the tag that was detected. Note that for tags with 10-digit IDs (e.g. V2 LifeTag), this will be represented by the first 8 digits in that ID.
	* `TagRSSI` - The signal strength of the transmission, measured in Decibels (DB). Values. closer to zero represent stronger signals. Values below -110 DB are typically not useful for estimating distance.
	* `NodeId` - The unique ID of the node from which the transmission was received.
	* `Validated` - Binary value that indicates whether the CRC value corroborated the unique tag ID. 0 = invalidated; 1 = validated. Note that only V2 LifeTags and above, and HybridTags, have a CRC value that can be read by SensorStations. If the CRC value corroborates the preceding 8 digit digital ID, then a "1" is shown in the `Validated` field. **This confirms, with a 99% accuracy, that that tag ID being detected is valid!**. *Note that PowerTags do not have a CRC value and therefore will never show a "1" in this field. PowerTags do not have variable power (like LifeTag and HybridTag) and therefore do not require the validation of a CRC value.* 

And two folders:

  * `SGData` - contains any 166MHz data collected by your station.
  * `uploaded` - contains any 434MHz data that has been previously uploaded to CTT servers.
  
***
# Downloading your data via the command line

If you can connect directly to your station via USB->Ethernet or WiFi, you can run a single line command to securely copy all files in the `Data` folder on your SensorStation, to a local file on your computer. This includes all of the data files mentioned in the previous section.

**Once your station is connected to your computer, open `Terminal` `(mac)` or `PowerShell` or `Command Prompt` `(PC)`**

The syntax is made of the following parts:

* `scp` : Secure Copy 
* `-r` : the flag for recursive, so that it securely copies all of the files, and folders, within the designated folder
* pi@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : this designates the Raspberry Pi on the SensorStation, at the specific IP address. The `x`'s represent the IP address of your specific SensorStation.
* `:/data` : this states that you'd like to copy the `data` folder that's in the root directory of the Raspberry Pi on your SensorStation (this is the file that contains all of the data- both CTT and SensorGnome)
* ` . ` : did you see that little period there? It has a space before it- make sure you include the space! The period just means that when you do this  `recursive` `secure copy` of all the files within the `data` folder on your SensorStation, you want to copy them **right where you are**. So whatever folder you are in when you started the command line, that's where it's going to go. That gives us this final command line code:

`scp -r pi@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/data .`

if you'd rather designate a destination folder, simply replace the final ` .` with the path of your choice. For example:

`scp -r pi@10.1.10.113:/data c:/Users/joeschmoscomputer/Downloads`

This would download the `data` folder from the SensorStation, to the `Downloads` folder on the local computer.

***

# Connecting to your SensorStation Web Interface

Your SensorStation has a web server running locally on the Raspberry Pi, which means you can interact with your station by directly connecting via Ethernet or through a wireless connection. **Note that this is different than viewing your SensorStation via the CTT Web Portal**. The SensorStation Interface provides an overview of your station's operation, including real-time statistics on detections of tags and nodes, as well as controls to change settings, update your SensorStation software, toggle the GSM modem, and reboot the station. It is always best practice to connect directly to your SensorStation prior to deployment. From here you can run a station update, ensure your antennas are tuned to the expected task (detecting Nodes or Tags) and see in real-time that your station is detecting either as expected.

## Connecting via Ethernet Cable

### Before you get started you will need...

  * 2 USB to Ethernet adapters (we recommend: https://tinyurl.com/yc6llze4)
  * An Ethernet cable
  
### Making the Connection

  1. Connect each end of the Ethernet cable to the two USB->Ethernet adapters.
  2. Plug one USB end of an adapter into any of the USB ports on your SensorStation.
  3. Plug the USB end of the second adapter into your computer and wait up to two minutes to allow the SensorStation to acquire the IP address from your computer.
  4. You can test this connection through several diagnostics in the LCD menu.
    * `Network > Ping` will indicate a connection.
    * `Network > IP Address` will display a valid IP address.
  5. Open a web browser on your computer, and put the IP address from Step 5 into the URL window of the browser. The web interface should appear.
  
  *If for some reason you are unable to connect after Step 3, try restarting both the SensorStation and your computer and continue to Step 4.*
  
***

## Adding your WiFi Credentials to your SensorStation via the Command Line

### Before you get started you will need...

  * **For V3 stations**, you don't need an extra WiFi adapter since it's already included on every board
  * For V1 or V2 stations, you'll need a WiFi adapter Like this one: https://store.celltracktech.com/products/wifi-usb-adapter-add-on-for-sensorstation-v2.
  * 2 USB to Ethernet adapters (we recommend: https://tinyurl.com/yc6llze4)
  * An Ethernet cable
  
### Gather important information
  
1. Take note of the **Wifi name** and **password** for the network you want to link with your SensorStation.
2. Connect to your SensorStation via the Ethernet cable (see above section for details)
3. On V2 or V3 stations, record the IP address from the LDC screen (under Network > IP Address)
3. On V1 stations record the IP address that appears on the eInk display.

### SSH into the Pi to update the connectivity settings

5. Type the following:

*For V1 or V2 stations:* `ssh pi@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (where the x’s represent your SensorStation IP address) 

**For V3 Stations:** `ssh ctt@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (where the x’s represent your SensorStation IP address) 

6. Answer `yes` to any dialogues, and when prompted for the password, enter the password for the Raspberry Pi 

**For V3 Stations:** The password is `ctt-station`

*For later V2 stations:* The password is `ctt-sensor`

*For V1 stations and early V2 stations:* The password is `raspberry`. Note if `raspberry` is your password, *please change your password* via the `raspi-config` you will access in the next step. Just choose `change password` instead of `Network Options` below.

7. At this point you should be in the Secure Shell within your Raspberry Pi. From here issue the following command:

`sudo raspi-config`

**Depending on the version of Raspberry Pi firmware running, you may see several different menus. If you see #2 is 'Network Options', then select it and move onto step 8. Otherwise select the first option, and the next menu should show `Network Options`.** 

8. From the config dialogue use the DOWN ARROW to select `Network Options`

9. Then choose `N2 Wireless LAN - Enter SSID and PASSPHRASE`

10. From there enter your `wireless network ID (SSID)` and the `password/phrase` for your WiFi network.

11. `Save` and `exit`. 

12. Close the terminal. 

13. Restart your SensorStation. 

### Wirelessly connect to your SensorStation

Once your SensorStation reboots, it should automatically connect to the existing wireless network, and you will be able to reach the station via any device on the same wireless network. Note that the IP address for your station will have changed- but in most cases you can use the `Hostname` to connect, or you can run `arp -a` from the command-line to search for your station's new IP address.

14. Open up a web browser and try and connect by typing the following Hostname into the address bar:

**For V2 & V3 SensorStations:**
`http://sensorstation.local`

*For V1 SensorStations:*
`http://raspberrypi.local`

15. If that doesn’t work, check the LCD screen for the IP address, and enter `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' into your web browser address field, where the `x`'s are the IP address #s

## Uploading your WiFi Credentials to your SensorStation via the USB Port

On V2 and V3 SensorStations, instead of manually updating the WiFi credentials via SSH, you can use the `Get WiFi` function available via the LCD menu to upload a credentials file. Follow the steps below to learn how.

### Before you get started you will need...

  * WiFi adapter Like this one: https://store.celltracktech.com/products/wifi-usb-adapter-add-on-for-sensorstation-v2.
  * Properly formatted USB thumb drive (Fat-32 or MS-DOS formatting currently supported).
  * A code editor where you can control the programming language and line encoding. We recommend the free Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com).
  
### Creating the JSON file

  1. In your code editor, create a new file and set the **Language Mode** to `JSON` and the **End of Line Sequence** to **LF** (for Line Feed).
  2. Type the following into the file:
  ```
    {
      "ssid":"my_ssid",
      "psk":"my_password" 
    }
  ````
  
  **Make sure you change "my_ssid" to the name of your wifi network and "my_password" to the password for your wifi network!**
  
  
  3. Save the file and name it `credentials.json`.
  4. Create an empty folder on your USB thumb drive called `wifi`.
  5. Copy `credentials.json` file to the `wifi` folder.

### Loading the JSON file onto your SensorStation

  1. Make sure your SensorStation is powered on and the menu is visible on the LCD screen
  2. Insert your USB thumb drive into any of the USB ports on your SensorStation.
  3. Using the four buttons right of the LCD screen, navigate to `File Transfer > Mount USB` and click the `Select` button.
  4. You should receive a `success` message.
  5. Now navigate to `File Transfer > Get WiFi` and click the `Select` button.
  6. You should receive a `success` message.
  7. Restart your SensorStation.
  8. After restart, your SensorStation should be connected to your local wifi network. You can test this connection through several diagnostics in the LCD menu.
  * `Network > Ping` will indicate a connection.
  * `Network > IP Address` will display a valid IP address.
  
### Connecting to your wifi-enabled SensorStation

Once your station has connected to your wifi network, you can connect to your SensorStation wirelessly via any device on the **same wifi network** as the station.

  * Connect your computer, tablet or smartphone to the same wifi network as your SensorStation.
  * open a web browser on your computer, tablet or smartphone and navigate to the IP address found via the `Network > IP Address` on your SensorStation's LCD screen. Alternatively you can use the name found in `Network > Hostname`, which is typically `sensorstation.local`.

# The SensorStation Interface Explained


## Nodes

At the very top of the page you will see the header titled **Nodes**. This is a list of Nodes the station has detected since connecting. For each Node it lists: 

`Node ID` 
`Last Heard` - the time of the last health report
`Node RSSI` - the RSSI of the Node signal in decibels
`Battery Voltage` - the Node’s battery voltage, which can be used to estimate its remaining life. 4.2 V is very full. 3.5 Vis low. 3 V is nearly empty.
`Node Firmware Version`

## Live Tags

This is a list of unique tags (PowerTag, LifeTag or HybridTag) that have been detected by your radios since connecting to your computer. For each tag it lists:

* `Tag ID` - unique 8-digit digital ID
* `Count` - number of beeps since last page refresh
* `Alias` - for convenience, a name can be given to a particular tag and saved in the browser by hitting the `Update` button. This information is saved in your browser only. Name it whatever you’d like. Great for keeping track of particular tags during a test.
* `“Update” Button` - save the name of a particular tag to your browser
* `“Remove” Button` - reset the saved name

Below the Live Tag list is a histogram of tags detected since opening the interface. The bars indicate the number of beeps detected.

## Station

On the right-hand sidebar of the page you'll see the **Station** section, which includes various pieces of information about your SensorStation.

* `ID` - the serial number of your SensorStation (the cell modem’s IMEI)
* `Software Start` - a date/time field referring to the last reboot time
* `Compute Module Serial` - the serial number of your Raspberry Pi Compute Module
* `Module Hardware` - the compute module’s hardware version
* `Module Revision` - the compute module’s hardware revision
* `Boot Count` - the number of times the system has been booted
* `Total Memory` - the amount of RAM currently being used by the system
* `Last Boot` - Datetime of last boot
* `Internet Gateway` - 

## System Versioning Details

* `Memory Usage` - A pie chart indicating the amount of system RAM currently being used.
* `CPU Usage` - A pie chart indicating the amount of processing power currently being used.
* `Time Sync Stats` - Detailed information of how the system time is being retrieved synced (e.g. from GPS or the internet)

## SensorStation Log

A log of SensorStation activity. Includes things such as screen updates and data retrieval flushes.

## GPS

Information retrieved over GPS: Time, Satellites, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude. If there is currently no valid fix, these fields will be blank.

## Radios (1-5)

There is a display box for each Radio port. The boxes will display all new data from each Radio port as they are detected, informing you of the following:

* `Time`
* `Tag ID`
* `RSSI`
* `Node`from which it came (if applicable).

### Radio Configuration

Each of the five 434MHz radios can be individually configured to receive `Nodes`, `Tags (FSK)`, or `OOK (legacy tags)` by clicking the corresponding button. On V1 SensorStations this configuration will only persist until the next webpage refresh unless you press the “Save Radio Configuration” button below, which will save the configuration permanently to memory. For V2 SensorStations the setting is automatically saved as soon as you acknowledge the confirmation popup after clicking the `Node`, `Tag` or `OOK` buttons for a particular radio. Configurations can be changed at any time. **Note that once you have changed the radio settings, the change is immediately saved and the data will flow from whichever you changed it to; node or tag, but in order to see the text description change on the web interface, you will need to refresh the webpage.**

`Node` = CTT Nodes Only
`Tag` = CTT LifeTags, PowerTags, ES-200 and ES-150 GPS tags
`OOK` = Legacy-style LifeTag only for limited specialized project

`Clear Session Data` simply clears the scrolling log of tags displayed for each radio port. It does not delete any data from system memory.

## Data Management

The data management section is the interface through which your station data is retrieved and deleted.


## Server Utilities

From the Server Utilities section on the web interface, you can now `Update Your SensorStation` to the latest deployment build, as well as force `Check In` and force `Upload Data` to the CTT servers.

**Requirement:**

  * Because these buttons require connecting to servers via the internet, your SensorStation must be connected to the internet, either via the *on-board LTE module*, hardwired via *Ethernet* (this includes being connected to a computer via Ethernet which is connected to the internet), or wirelessly via a *WiFi adapter*.

### Updating your SensorStation

  1. With the CTT Sensor Station Overview page open in your browser, scroll down to `Server Utilities` on the right sidebar. 
  2. Click the button labeled `Station Update`, which will open the `Sensor Station Software Updater` console
  3. Scroll down below the console window and click on the `Update Station` button. This will begin the update process. Be aware that the station will be pulling code from five different code bases, which may take up to several minutes depending on your connection speed. 
  4. When the process is complete, you will receive a `Station connection disconnected` dialogue. **This indicates that the update is complete** and that the system has restarted. You may now click the dialogue to clear it, and then click the button at the bottom of the screen to go `Back to Main Interface`. 
  

## Station Log

Allows you to **download** (`Download Log File`) and **PERMANENTLY DELETE** (`Clear Log File`) the system log file. Used for informational and debugging purposes.

## CTT Tag Data

The tag data is divided into `Current Data`, `Data Not Uploaded`, and `Data Already Uploaded`. Current Data is data from the last 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, data is rotated into Data Not Uploaded, which is data beyond the last 30 minutes which has not yet been uploaded to CTT servers. If there is an internet connection via cell or ethernet, an upload attempt occurs every 2 hours. After data is uploaded, it is rotated into `Data Already Uploaded` and will stay there until you explicitly delete it. The red Delete buttons will **PERMANENTLY DELETE** the corresponding data from the SensorStation. An *are you sure* dialogue will make sure you do not accidentally delete data.

## Nanotag Data

Nanotag Data uses the same scheme as CTT Tag Data, except that currently data from the last 30 minutes is unavailable from this screen. The Sensorgnome interface is separately accessible as described below.

### Nanotag Data / Sensorgnome Interface

## Sensorgnome Interface

Click the “Sensorgnome Interface” button to go to the Sensorgnome interface.

## Sensorgnome Deployment File

The Sensorgnome Deployment file can be edited here and saved by clicked `Save Changes`.

## Reboot Button

Reboots the system.

# Troubleshooting

**I get an error when I attempt to mount my USB drive**

*Your USB drive may not be formatted properly*

**I have successfully mounted my USB drive but when I go to `Add Wifi` I get an error**

*Either your USB drive is not formatted properly (some formats will allow you to mount, but not to read the file, such as X-Fat on Mac)* **or** *your JSON file is not properly formatted.*

  * Verify the following:
    * Your file is named `credentials.json`
    * Your file is in a folder called `wifi`
    * There is only one folder called `wifi` on your USB thumb drive
    * Your JSON file was created with the End of Line Sequence set to **LF**
    * Your JSON file was properly formatted (see **#2** under **Creating the JSON file** above)

## The Motus Wildlife Tracking System

When tracking wildlife with automated radio telemetry over vast distances, the challenge of deploying enough receivers to get detections grows exponentially. To remedy this, data can be shared between all researchers so that essentially everyone is sharing receivers. This greatly expands the potential for this technology, but it comes with the added responsibility of coordinating projects, detection data and metadata - that’s where Motus comes in.

## What is Motus?

The Motus Wildlife Tracking System is an international collaborative network of researchers that use automated radio telemetry to simultaneously track hundreds of individuals of numerous species of birds, bats, and insects. The system enables a community of researchers, educators, organizations, and citizens to undertake impactful research and education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals. When compared to other technologies, automated radio telemetry currently allows researchers to track the smallest animals possible, with high temporal and geographic precision, over great distances.

## How does Motus work?

The entire philosophy behind Motus is that we’re all working together. At its core, Motus is community science. A community of researchers around the world conducting research on animals are tracked by a network of receiving stations maintained by a community of researchers, organizations, non-profits, governments, and individuals. In order for this concept to work, the system requires a centralized database and management system that all participants use. Most importantly, in order for your tags to be detected on any other station in the network, or for other project tags to be detected elsewhere, projects, receivers and tags need to be registered with, and have data processed by Motus. 

While any automated telemetry project can operate in isolation, operating as a Motus project combines the collective impact of local, regional, and even hemispheric projects into one massive collaborative effort that expands the scale and scope of everyone’s work and maximizes the use of scarce research dollars.  It also makes data available and more useful for future projects, collaborative endeavors and large-scale meta analyses. 

## What’s the cost? 

There is NO cost to register your project and receivers to the Motus network and contribute your data. Tags registered to the network are charged a nominal fee to support data processing and ongoing maintenance and development of the system. See the collaboration policy and fee schedule for more information. 

## Data Ownership/Privacy 

The collaborative nature of Motus relies on a certain level of transparency with respect to data. While basic project and tag summary information is made publicly available, researchers have the ability to customize data accessibility and keep their project and data private if necessary. See the collaboration policy for more information.

# Appendix II: Quickstart Guide (Sensorstation V2){V2Quickstart}

## Prior to Powering Up
* Ensure power switch is in the `OFF` position
* Connect your power source to your SensorStation

## Initial Boot-up of a SensorStation
* Switch power switch into the `ON` position
* Wait for full boot-up (the LCD screen is the last thing to boot up, so once the LCD menu is visible, you are fully booted)




***

# Appendix III: Qickstart Guide (SensorStation V1){#V1Quickstart}

***Courtesy of David Brinker***

## Powering Up

1. Plug in the e-ink screen (if you have one).
    a. Your screen fits snugly onto the Pi-Hat expansion port provided, and will sit right on top of your Pi Compute Module. *Note: Make sure the unit is off when swapping any components, and be careful when removing the screen not to bend the pins, it should lift straight up.*
2. Plug in power wires.
    a. Make sure the **ON/OFF** switch is in the `OFF` position.
    b. Locate the **Green power block** about an inch below the on ON/OFF switch. IT is marked with `POWER` on the left and `12VDC` on the right of the block.
    c. Make sure that the power source is properly connected to a solar charge controller or a 12VDC Power adapter and the wires are labeled or color coded to positive and negative.
    d. We recommend leaving the power disconnected while connecting the wires to the SensorStation. It also works better to install wires that are tinned with solder with about ¼” showing.
    e. Depress each orange tab with a small straight screwdriver on the green power block to insert each wire. The positive is on the left and negative is on the right and marked with a +/- below the block. See images to right.

## Initial Boot-up of a SensorStation

1. This is a simple set of instructions for the initial boot up of a SensorStation.
Turn on the SensorStation using the slide switch on the left center of the SensorStation board.
2. The SensorStation board will show two constantly illuminated LEDs, an orange one and a green one on the left side of the board.  There will also be green and blue flashing LEDs.

3. A normally operating SensorStation will present all four LEDs.
4. The Inkyphat display will show the CTT SensorStation welcome.

5. The display normally updates every 90 seconds.  During initial boot-up the display update usually takes longer than 90 seconds.  Wait for the SensorStation to complete boot-up.  Once the display updates it will change to the default operating screen display.

6. This display shows that the SensorStation is operating, the battery voltage and the number of CTT transmitter detections (Beeps).  Note that in the top bar the display shows “No Cable”.  This indicates that no Ethernet connection is available between the SensorStation board and a laptop computer.
7. Insert a USB to Ethernet connector into one of the open USB ports on the SensorStation.

8. Connect your laptop to the SensorStation with an Ethernet cable.  Wait for the Inkyphat display to update.  Once the display updates you will see the IP address assigned to the combination of your laptop and SensorStation in the top bar of the display.  In this example the assigned IP address is 169.254.54.185.

9. Now you are ready to view the operating status of the SensorStation on two different, and necessary, web interfaces.  There are separate web interfaces for the CTT and Motus (Sensorgnome) systems.  Open your web browser and enter the IP address into the address bar to open a new web page.  The CTT web interface will open.


10. If you have CTT LifeTags with you as test tags, they will show up as hits in the “Tags” window.  The Station summary on the right includes information similar to the header of the familiar Sensorgnome display.  The most important item is the “ID” number as that is needed to register the station with Motus.  It also includes the time of the last boot and a boot counter.  For more information on status scroll down through the display.  The additional information includes windows for each of the five CTT antenna ports.


11. There is a section for data management that we can skip when setting up a station, 
that section may be more useful to us in the future.  Just below data management there is a blue button “Sensorgnome Interface”.  Clicking on this button will open the familiar Sensorgnome web interface in a new window.

12. FYI - you can edit the “deployment.txt” file in the provided box.  At the bottom of the box there is a red “Save Changes” button.  If you edit the deployment.txt file, do not forget to save your changes!  The “Reboot” button also works as expected and pressing it will reboot the SensorStation.


13. You can leave both the CTT web interface and the Sensorgnome web interface open at the same time in your web browser and switch back and forth as necessary.  The Sensorgnome web interface pretty much operates as expected.  Please note that SensorStations do not use the GPS’s clock to manage time and that you will always get the ***PPS missing*** warning on the Sensorgnome interface.

Clicking on “Sensor Station Interface” will open a new SensorStation page and move you to it.  It is generally easier to switch back and forth between pages rather than clicking on the words to keep opening new windows.


14. You can set Funcube frequencies directly in the “Devices” window and most other functions should operate as expected.  Currently there is no way to upload a tag database to the SensorStation.


This should be enough to get us started and allow us to leave sites with confidence that the SensorStations are operating correctly.
