# **Argos-enabled Device Registration and Data Fees**

## **Overview**

Unlike our cellular-based devices, Argos-enabled devices (e.g., ES-150, ES-500) require **direct coordination with CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites)** to activate Argos data service. You’ll need to establish an Argos Program and obtain unique Argos IDs from CLS before your device can be built or configured.

**Important**: CLS requires up to **30 days** for program approval, so begin this process early.

---

## **Step 1: Register with CLS**

To begin, visit:
[http://www.argos-system.org/become-a-user/](http://www.argos-system.org/become-a-user/)

During the registration process, you will need to provide information about your Argos transmitter:

* **Manufacturer**: Cellular Tracking Technologies
* **Model**: SATX-1 PCB

There is **no cost** to establish an Argos Program until you begin transmitting data.

---

## **Step 2: Share Your Argos Info with Us**

Once you’ve received your Argos Program and Argos IDs:

* Share the **Program Name** and **Argos ID(s)** with us.
* These IDs must be copied to our account to:

  * Complete device setup and programming
  * Ensure data are interpretable and accessible via our web portal

**Note**: We cannot complete your device build without a valid Argos ID.

---

## **Argos Data Fees (via CLS)**

These fees are **billed directly by CLS**, not through Cellular Tracking Technologies.

### **Minimum Monthly Fee**

CLS only charges once data is transmitted.
However, the typical minimum monthly cost is:

* \$15/month base fee
* Plus \$4/day (JTA) or \$6/day (Private)

**Estimated minimum total: \$19–\$21 per tag, per month**

---

### **Maximum Monthly Fee (Capped)**

CLS applies a monthly cap after 12 days of transmission:

| User Type | Daily Fee | Max Monthly Fee          |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| JTA       | \$4/day   | \$15 + (\$4 × 12) = \$63 |
| Private   | \$6/day   | \$15 + (\$6 × 12) = \$87 |

Regardless of how many days the tag transmits, you will not be charged more than this capped amount.

---

### **Can Devices Be “Paused” to Save Costs?**

Yes. CLS can remove your Argos ID and recycle it, effectively pausing billing.

However:

* No data will be collected while the ID is inactive.
* Any data transmitted during this time will be lost and unrecoverable.

---

## **JTA vs. Private Rates**

Your classification is determined by the **space agency**, not CLS.

Here’s a general guideline:

| Organization Type                    | Likely Classification |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| University / Non-profit / Government | JTA                   |
| Commercial (e.g., film crews, media) | Private               |

If you’re unsure, you can register your System Use Agreement in advance. Once approved, your user type will be confirmed. There is no cost to open an account with CLS.

## **GSM Data Fees (CTT Devices Only)**

If your device also uses GSM (cellular) connectivity, GSM data fees are billed **by Cellular Tracking Technologies**, not CLS. These fees are outlined on our webstore:
