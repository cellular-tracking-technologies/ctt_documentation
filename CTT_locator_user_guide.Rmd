# Powering on the Locator

To power on the Locator, press the switch to on. A blue light will immedately shine, indicating the Locator has power. After a short bootup sequence, the Locator will create a hotspot for your phone to connect to. Due to technical limitations, Android phones will need to turn off Cellular Data. This is not required on iPhone devices. 

In addition to phones, the Locator can be used with laptops, tablets, and other modern devices.

When the blue light flashes, the Locator is in its final stages of booting. It will be ready in about 10 seconds after this indication.

Connect to a WiFi network created by the Locator.

The circle on the right will flash red when a tag is detected. A rotating circle animation indicates that the locator is actively connected to the phone. The far right icon indicates battery life, and contains the voltage. Approximately 4.10 volts is a full battery, 3.7 volts is half full, and 3.4 volts is empty. This will also be indicated by the battery slowly reducing, similar to your smart phone.
