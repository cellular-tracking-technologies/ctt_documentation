## The CTT Locator

The CTT Locator is a portal device that can receive a variety of wildlife tag signals. It is compatible with the entire radio tag line, including ES200 devices. 

# Getting Started

## In the Box

* Yagi Antenna
* BNC to SMA coaxial adapter
* SMA coaxial cable
* CTT Locator with integrated Lithium Polymer battery and USB charger port

# Powering on the Locator

1. To power on the Locator, press the switch to on. 
  A blue light will immediately shine, indicating the Locator has power. 
  After a short bootup sequence, the Locator will create a hotspot for your phone to connect to. **Due to technical limitations, Android phones will need to turn off Cellular Data. This is not required on iPhone devices.** In addition to phones, the Locator can be used with laptops, tablets, and other modern devices.

When the blue light flashes, the Locator is in its final stages of booting. It will be ready in about 10 seconds after this indication.

2. Connect to a WiFi network created by the Locator. 

3. Enter this full url into the browser. Note that the `https://` is important:

```
https://locator.click/
```

In a few moments, a webpage will load and show the main locator screen. 

# Screen Overview


When you load the Locator screen, an interface will appear. You can change the various modes of the locator by clicking on the icons at the bottom.

First, we will go over the title bar:

![](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/110702200-37837c80-81c0-11eb-8b96-cd1b77ff5d68.png){#id .class width=100%}

The circle on the right will flash red when a tag is detected. A rotating circle animation indicates that the locator is actively connected to the phone. The far right icon indicates battery life, and contains the voltage. Approximately 4.10 volts is a full battery, 3.7 volts is half full, and 3.4 volts is empty. This will also be indicated by the battery slowly reducing, similar to your smart phone. 

Next we will go over the icons at the bottom:

![](/Users/davidlapuma/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/110702544-a82a9900-81c0-11eb-84f1-a844e8c9f164.png){#id .class width=100%}

* The `Home` icon shows all detected tags in a list, which is the default view when you first connect to the device. For more details, see the Home View section.

* The `Identify` icon helps you identify unknown tags or verify a tag's ID when it is in close range. For more details, see the Identify View section.

* The `Favorites` icon is a place where you can see the tags you have specified as favorites. This is useful when a lot of other tags are nearby and you wish to focus on a specific tag. For more details, see the Favorites View section.

* The `Search` icon is where you can search for tags within all of the tags recently detected during your session. For more details, see the Search View section.

* The `Download` icon allows you to download all collected tag data as well as ES200 data. For more details, see the Download View section.

* The `Settings` icon allows you to control various locator settings and options. For more details, see the Settings View section.

# Home View

![*Home View*](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/105431612-ee816400-5c23-11eb-8a11-b1b6b08be0dd.png)

The `home` view shows all nearby tags. If a tag is first seen, it will show up as red, to indicate a new tag has been detected. If the tag is seen again, it will turn black. Each time the tag is detected, the text will briefly flash yellow to indicate it has been updated.

![*Locator main view*](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110704154-94803200-81c2-11eb-9a92-9746662533c3.jpg)

# Tag View

<img width="523" alt="tagview" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110847880-7296b600-827b-11eb-8a4f-2a0f54bd3b7f.png">

The `tag` view provides a signal strength indicator to help you localize a tag. As the tag signal gets stronger, more bars appear. the negative number under the signal bars is the signal strength in dBm, or decibel milliwatts. The lower the number, the weaker the signal. 

A large circle is at the top of the Tag View. This flashes when the tag is received. Under this is the last time the tag was seen.

Touching or clicking the X in the top right corner closes tha tag view.

You can add a tag to your favorites list by tapping the "Favorite" button. Tapping this again removes the tag from your favorites.

# Identify View

<img width="524" alt="identifyview" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110849281-0ddc5b00-827d-11eb-9c56-1e7f5698627d.png">

In the `Identify` view, tags will appear if they have signals stronger than -30 dBm. This would be a tag in very close proximity to the locator. 

# Favorite View

<img width="519" alt="favoriteview" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110849575-37958200-827d-11eb-9241-26b034bc2e64.png">

Any tags that are selected as favorites will enter the `Favorite` view. You can click on any tag here to see the Tag View of any tag in this list, just as you would in the main view.

# Search View 

<img width="532" alt="searchview" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110850316-a672db00-827d-11eb-8eca-01d773755ac7.png">

The `Search` view lets you type in a tag ID, which is then searched against tags detected during that session. Note that the history of tags clears each time you open or reload the locator interface. It will not search against any tag ever detected with the locator.

# Download View

<img width="523" alt="downloadview" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110851296-da9acb80-827e-11eb-905f-59649bc14a68.png">

The `Download` view is where you can download both ES200 and Tag Data. Clicking on these will initiate a download to your device.

# Settings View

<img width="522" alt="settingsview1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110851252-cd7ddc80-827e-11eb-8980-ce98a956d307.png">

<img width="530" alt="settingsview2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101026/110851261-cfe03680-827e-11eb-824f-a0f1c666c6ff.png">
