# Congratulations

If you are reading this document, then you most likely have purchased one of our Internet of Wildlife (IoW) components. Whether you're doing localized detailed studies of small mammals or songbirds, or you're setting up SensorStations as part of the global Motus Wildlife Tracking System (motus.org), or you're doing something in-between, we've got you covered, and this document is meant to help you get started quickly and painlessly. If for some reason you get stuck along the way, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly either via email (support@celltracktech.com) or through our online Help Desk here: https://celltracktech.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals.

# Setting up your CTT IoW System

CTT’s Internet of Wildlife System (IoW) is a complete radio telemetry system that consists of transmitters (radio tags), and receivers. Currently CTT produces four radio transmitters: the LifeTag^TM^, PowerTag^TM^, ES-200 and ES-150. 

### LifeTag

The **CTT LifeTag** is 100% solar powered, and therefore has no battery. This allows the tag to persist for many years, beeping out its unique digital ID whenever it has sunlight. For species active during the day, and for small animals for which multi-season or multi-year data are required, LifeTags are the obvious choice.

### PowerTag

The **CTT PowerTag** is battery powered which means it can beep out its digitally coded ID 24-hours a day. The life span of a PowerTag is defined by the beep rate (# of beeps per minute) and battery size. For species where nighttime data is important, PowerTags are the perfect fit.

### ES-200 and ES-150

The **ES-200** and **ES-150** are GPS logger tags that can also send data over the 434MHz frequency, and therefore can send archived telemetry data to the SensorStation. Since they communicate on the same frequency as LifeTags and PowerTags, no special radio configuration is needed. The difference between the two is that the ES-150 also has an Argos radio to send data via the Argos satellite network.

### CTT SensorStation

The **CTT SensorStation** collect data directly from tags and can collect data from a series of Nodes to more precisely locate tags within a study site. The SensorStation stores data and, with an optional GSM data plan, can also send those data directly to the CTT Servers. 

### CTT Node

**CTT Nodes** are essentially *mini-base stations*: devices with integrated solar panels, a lithium battery, and an antenna to collect data from **PowerTags** and **LifeTags** and send those data to the **SensorStation**. These data can then be post-processed to localize tags within a grid of nodes over user-defined time steps.

## Understanding Detection Distances

The detection distance **from Node to Tag** varies for various reasons, including terrain, vegetation, and the behavior of the tagged animals. For instance, a bird flying overhead may be picked up over a kilometer away by a node, but one foraging in dense vegetation may only be detected from a few hundred meters. When using nodes for localization it's important to note that the accuracy of locations of animals wearing tags can be as little as less than 5m, but can range widely depending on the density of Nodes. For localizing tag positions, the spacing and placement of nodes must allow for tags to be detected simultaneously by three or more nodes.

The detection distance from SensorStation to Node is also affected by terrain and vegetation, but also antenna height and type (omni-directional vs. directional). **Therefore, while there is no hard and fast rule, a good starting point is to keep your farthest node within 1-1.5km of the SensorStation.** The number of SensorStations needed for each system depends on the size of the study area. For instance, in a 2 KM^2^ plot, a SensorStation placed at the center of the plot could detect nodes across the entire study area, in most cases with only an omni-directional antenna. Because Nodes are dependent on the SensorStation to receive their data and aggregate it for analysis, it is critical to ensure each node is within the detection radius of at least one SensorStation at all times. 


## Mounting your Equipment

For both the SensorStation and Nodes we recommend attaching to **EMT conduit**.  We recommend this because it is rigid and easy to set up. This is *not* what’s commonly referred to as *Black Pipe* used for water and gas lines, but the **galvanized steel pipe** used for running electrical wiring inside. 

![](/Users/davidlapuma/github/ctt_documentation/images/EMT.png){#id .class width=25%}

**We don’t recommend PVC** because it moves in the wind, becomes brittle, and will snap over time. EMT can be painted if you would like them camouflaged.

The conduit can be attached to a tripod, mounted directly into the ground, or onto a building or other structure. The Nodes and SensorStations are then attached to the conduit. The diameter of the conduit is typically 1” for the top mast section of the SensorStation (the section to which the antennas are attached; light green in the picture below).

![](/Users/davidlapuma/github/ctt_documentation/images/SSinstall.png){#id .class width=25%}
### SensorStation Masts

### Building a mast for your SensorStation

For every 7 feet of height the base section will increase in diameter by ¼”. For example, in the picture above, a 15 foot mast will have a 1” section (light green) inserted into a 1 ¼” (orange) and then into a 1 ½” (blue). If the conduit is inserted into the ground, the 1 ½” conduit should be inserted into a 4’ section of 2” pipe (dark green). The pipe in the ground is cut in half, the bottom flattened slightly with sledge hammer to keep soil from entering when it is driven into the ground. A block of wood can be used to pound the pipe into the ground to prevent bending the pipe.  If the antenna mast is shorter,  the next size up gets driven into the ground (1/ ¼”). Note that standard EMT conduit does eventually rust, however it will remain very strong for 6-10 years. 

If desired, stainless conduit can be purchased, however it is much more expensive, but **recommended if you are in an area that receives high winds**. It is crucial to overlap each section of pipe by at least 2 feet. **Self tapping screws** are used to hold pipes together, but should not be used within 3-4” of the end of the pipes and/or seams. The chart below should help with what is needed for your setup per SensorStation.

| Total Approx Mast Ht.| EMT Needed for mast (10')| Ground Section Needed (4')| Coax Length Per Antenna |
| :------------------: | :----------------------: | :-----------------------: | :---------------------: |
|     7'               |    1"                    |     1 1/4"                |   min 10ft              |
|    15’               |    1”,1 ¼”               |     1 ½”                  |   min 20’               |
|    23’               |    1”, 1 ¼”, 1 ½”        |     2”                    |   min 25’               |
|    28’               |    1”, 1 ¼”, 1 ½”        |     2”- Use full 10’      |   min 30’               |

***Masts higher than 28' not recommended with standard free-standing EMT conduit. Guy wires and/or scaffolded or tripod masts are other options for higher towers.***

### Mounting Nodes

Nodes are typically attached to the top of a ¾” piece of EMT. The clamps shown below come standard with the nodes and accept ¾ or 1” conduit. 

![](/Users/davidlapuma/github/ctt_documentation/images/nodeClamp.jpg){#id .class width=25%}

A 7/16” socket is used to tighten the clamp bolts. The EMT is typically driven into the ground approximately 2 feet. The height of the nodes can be changed depending on the project, but for best results should be consistent within a study site. We recommend 8’ for most setups, see below for pictures of the node setup in the field. If you choose an alternate mounting method, care should be taken that they are secure. If they are mounted on anything that sways greatly with the wind, the readings won’t be consistent.

![](/Users/davidlapuma/github/ctt_documentation/images/NodeBernh2.jpg){#id .class width=25%}

**Note:** ***Nodes purchased in 2020 and beyond have a built-in GPS. Prior to 2020 you must take accurate GPS readings and record that data with the Node ID in order to run post-hoc localization analyses.***


## Node Placement

Setting up the CTT Nodes is typically done in a grid in your study site. It is not imperative that they are exactly in a grid, but the closer you can set them up in a grid, the more accurate positioning you will get from the tags. In sites where this is not practical, you can simply set them up where you can, 100-300m apart, and record GPS of the Node locations. Even in a grid setup, it is best practice to take GPS coordinates whether or not they differ from the layout.

## SensorStation Placement

The CTT IoW SensorStation may be placed anywhere within range of the farthest node, which is typically 1-1.5km (although higher placement of SensorStation antennas, and clear line-of-sight between stations and nodes, can achieve longer detection distances). See the next section on SensorStation Configuration and Antenna Detail for more details on this. It is recommended to place the SensorStation antennas at least 2 meters high. The higher the antennas, the better range you will get.

## SensorStation Configuration and Antenna Detail

The standard configuration for the CTT SensorStation allows for receiving data on *five 434MHz* radio ports simultaneously. These can be configured to either record signals from LifeTags/PowerTags and ES-200 GPS loggers (hereafter "tags"), or to collect data from CTT Nodes. *Tags and Nodes cannot be picked up on the same channel*, and how you configure your station depends depends on your study goals. The number of channels necessary on a SensorStation depends on the number of Nodes, whether you want to detect tags/transmitters and/or Nodes directly with the SensorStation, and the distance the Nodes are from the SensorStation.There is no hard limit to the number of nodes that can be detected by a single SensorStation, but it's best to keep that number around 50 or less. *Distance to the SensorStation will usually be the limiting factor for the number of nodes detectable by a single SensorStation.*

Two types of antennas are commonly used with the SensorStation: *Omnidirectional* and *Yagi*. *Omnidirectional antennas* efficiently receive energy in a *horizontal plane 360 degrees around the SensorStation*. Omnidirectional antennas typically do not have as great a range as Yagis, but a benefit is the 360 degree detection, and great detection of tags and nodes that are near the station. 

**Note: Whereas in the past we have recommended specific polarization for omnidirectional antennas picking up Nodes vs. Tags, in our testing we have found the difference negligeable and find vertical omni antennas to be much simpler and less expensive for a greater value over horizontally polarized omnis.** 

*Yagis are directional antennas* used to detect tags and nodes in a specific direction from the SensorStation. They *typically have a 30-60 degree detection range that extends away from the SensorStation*. For that reason typically 2-4 antennas are used, one pointed in each cardinal direction, or two pointed in opposite directions and used to make a “fence”. Yagis can also be used to pick up Nodes that are farther away from the SensorStation.

While there are many antennas to choose from, these are a few that we can recommend from experience:

  * Omni-directional
    * [Data Alliance A433O5](https://www.data-alliance.net/antenna-433mhz-5dbi-omnidirectional-fiberglass-w-n-male-vhf-uhf-marine/)
      * and you'll need [this bracket](https://www.data-alliance.net/l-mount-for-antenna-pole-or-wall-mount-hole-for-n-female-or-rp-sma/)
      * and [this adapter](https://www.data-alliance.net/n-type-female-to-female-coupler-adapter-w-o-ring-weatherproof-bulkhead/)
    
  * Yagi
    * [M2Inc 440-6SS](https://www.m2inc.com/FG4406SS)
    * [Laird YS4306](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Laird-Connectivity/YS4306?qs=EU6FO9ffTwelQ7%2FXOHiHew%3D%3D)
    * [Diamond A430S10](https://www.hamradio.com/detail.cfm?pid=H0-005816)
    * [Diamond A430S15](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/dmn-a430s15) *for specialized applications where longer-range is required
    
*__Whatever you choose, make sure you get the proper coaxaial end to connect your antenna to your SensorStation!__*

### Mounting the antennas

Antennas are attached to the EMT conduit with the clamps that come with the antennas. If you have a setup that uses 4 yagis, than you will attach the yagis to a 4 or 5-way mounting “hat” you can purchase via online retailers.  Once the antennas are on EMT, attach the coax and wrap the connection with coax tape. Run down the poles to where it will attach to the SensorStation. You can use zip ties to secure the coax to poles where needed. Make sure you have enough coax to form a drip loop for each connection.

![](/Users/davidlapuma/github/ctt_documentation/images/diagram_drip-loop.jpg)
### Placing your SensorStation
The SensorStation can be placed inside a building, or fastened to the pole or building, etc. It should either be close to the ground for easy access, or have an ethernet cable run down to an accessible location.

# Participating in the Motus Wildlife Tracking System

If you are setting up your SensorStation to participate in the Motus Wildlife Tracking System (motus.org), your station can still be used with CTT Nodes. In general, we recommend Motus stations to include 4 Yagi 10-element antennas pointing in the 4 cardinal directions. A fifth Omni antenna can be installed and dedicated to detecting nodes, or one of the Yagi antennas can be used for nodes while the other three are positioned at 120 degrees for full coverage.  You may also add any number of 166MHz antennas by using a Software Defined Radio (SDR), such as a FunCube or RTL-SDR, via any of the USB ports on the SensorStation (SDRs are sold separately via third-party companies). A clear view of the horizon is preferred to get maximum range, so a height as high as possible is also advised. For more information on Motus, see [Appendix I](#appendix_1).

# Operating your SensorStation with a solar panel and 12V Battery

The SensorStation can be connected directly to a 12V DC power source, or via a charge controller. Typical setup would be a 50-100W solar panel connected to a charge controller. The charge controller typically has 3 ports. The 3 ports are 1.) Solar panel 2.) 12V battery 3.) Accessory/Device/consumer- which is whatever you are powering- in this case your SensorStation. That line goes into the green *Power In* terminal on the SensorStation board. The positive and negative wire ports are labeled on the board, and to insert the wire simply loosen the set screws on the top, and slide the wire leads in to the holes just under the set screws (see the pictures below). 

![Power not connected](/Users/davidlapuma/github/ctt_documentation/images/power_out.png){#id .class width="20%"}
![Power connected](/Users/davidlapuma/github/ctt_documentation/images/power_in.png){#id .class width="20%"}

The ends of the wires that are attached should be tinned with solder for best results. If you do not have access to a soldering gun, twisting the ends of the cables tightly will help them slide in cleanly to the power block. 

## Monitoring your solar voltage

If you would like to monitor your solar voltage remotely, you will need to use the solar monitor connector. it is located above the on/off switch. Simply run two wires from the solar input of the charge controller to a two pin connector.

# The SensorStation Web Interface Overview 

## Overview

## Programming Radios

Your five 343MHz radios will typically arrive pre-configured to detect tags. You can see the configuration for each radio displayed on the web interface. Changing the programming is as simple as clicking the appropriate button. Click `Node` for detecting nodes or `Tag` for detecting LifeTags, PowerTags or ES-200 devices. The `OOK` tag is a specific legacy tag type only used on a few projects. **Note that once you have changed the radio settings, the change is immediately saved and the data will flow from whichever you changed it to; node or tag, but in order to see the text description change on the web interface, you will need to refresh the webpage.**

## Managing your SensorStation from the Web Interface Server Utilities

From the Server Utilities section on the web interface, you can now `Update Your SensorStation` to the latest deployment build, as well as force `Check In` and force `Upload Data` to the CTT servers.

**Requirement:**

  * Because these buttons require connecting to servers via the internet, your SensorStation must be connected to the internet, either via the *on-board LTE module*, hardwired via *Ethernet* (this includes being connected to a computer via Ethernet which is connected to the internet), or wirelessly via a *WiFi adapter*.

### Updating your SensorStation

  1. With the CTT Sensor Station Overview page open in your browser, scroll down to `Server Utilities` on the right sidebar. 
  2. Click the button labeled `Station Update`, which will open the `Sensor Station Software Updater` console
  3. Scroll down below the console window and click on the `Update Station` button. This will begin the update process. Be aware that the station will be pulling code from five different code bases, which may take up to several minutes depending on your connection speed. 
  4. When the process is complete, you will receive a `Station connection disconnected` dialogue. **This indicates that the update is complete** and that the system has restarted. You may now click the dialogue to clear it, and then click the button at the bottom of the screen to go `Back to Main Interface`.

# Troubleshooting

**I get an error when I attempt to mount my USB drive**

*Your USB drive may not be formatted properly*

**I have successfully mounted my USB drive but when I go to `Add Wifi` I get an error**

*Either your USB drive is not formatted properly (some formats will allow you to mount, but not to read the file, such as X-Fat on Mac)* **or** *your JSON file is not properly formatted.*

  * Verify the following:
    * Your file is named `credentials.json`
    * Your file is in a folder called `wifi`
    * There is only one folder called `wifi` on your USB thumb drive
    * Your JSON file was created with the End of Line Sequence set to **LF**
    * Your JSON file was properly formatted (see **#2** under **Creating the JSON file** above)
    * Note you can always check your code validity by pasting it into this website: https://jsonlint.com and clicking `Validate JSON`

## The Motus Wildlife Tracking System

When tracking wildlife with automated radio telemetry over vast distances, the challenge of deploying enough receivers to get detections grows exponentially. To remedy this, data can be shared between all researchers so that essentially everyone is sharing receivers. This greatly expands the potential for this technology, but it comes with the added responsibility of coordinating projects, detection data and metadata - that’s where Motus comes in.

## What is Motus?

The Motus Wildlife Tracking System is an international collaborative network of researchers that use automated radio telemetry to simultaneously track hundreds of individuals of numerous species of birds, bats, and insects. The system enables a community of researchers, educators, organizations, and citizens to undertake impactful research and education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals. When compared to other technologies, automated radio telemetry currently allows researchers to track the smallest animals possible, with high temporal and geographic precision, over great distances.

## How does Motus work?

The entire philosophy behind Motus is that we’re all working together. At its core, Motus is community science. A community of researchers around the world conducting research on animals are tracked by a network of receiving stations maintained by a community of researchers, organizations, non-profits, governments, and individuals. In order for this concept to work, the system requires a centralized database and management system that all participants use. Most importantly, in order for your tags to be detected on any other station in the network, or for other project tags to be detected elsewhere, projects, receivers and tags need to be registered with, and have data processed by Motus. 

While any automated telemetry project can operate in isolation, operating as a Motus project combines the collective impact of local, regional, and even hemispheric projects into one massive collaborative effort that expands the scale and scope of everyone’s work and maximizes the use of scarce research dollars.  It also makes data available and more useful for future projects, collaborative endeavors and large-scale meta analyses. 

## What’s the cost? 

There is NO cost to register your project and receivers to the Motus network and contribute your data. Tags registered to the network are charged a nominal fee to support data processing and ongoing maintenance and development of the system. See the collaboration policy and fee schedule for more information. 

## Data Ownership/Privacy 

The collaborative nature of Motus relies on a certain level of transparency with respect to data. While basic project and tag summary information is made publicly available, researchers have the ability to customize data accessibility and keep their project and data private if necessary. See the collaboration policy for more information.
