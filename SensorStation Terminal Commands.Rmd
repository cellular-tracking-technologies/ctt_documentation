# Terminal commands

If you are able to SSH into your Sensor Station (either over the internet or through a point-to-point connection), you can type or copy/paste these commands in your Mac or Linux terminal window (if you are using Windows, you will need to download GitBash or WSL).

## Internet

### IP Address
To find your IP station's Internet Protocol (IP) address:
: ```ifconfig```

#### WiFi
To obtain the IP address of your WiFi connection run the command below; your IP address will be next to the phrase "inet": 
: ```ifconfig | grep -a 'wlan0' -A 1 | grep -a 'inet'```

#### Ethernet
To obtain the IP address of your ethernet connection, run the command below; your IP address will be next to the phrase "inet":
: ```ifconfig | grep -a 'eth0' -A 1 | grep -a 'inet'```

### Enable/Disable WiFi
For stations running FunCubes or other 166MHz radios, you may need to disable the WiFi module for the radios to work properly.

#### Enable WiFi
To enable the WiFi module:
: ```/bin/bash /lib/ctt/sensor-station-software/system/scripts/enable-wifi.sh```

#### Disable WiFi
To disable the WiFi module:
: ```/bin/bash /lib/ctt/sensor-station-software/system/scripts/disable-wifi.sh```

## Cellular Modem

### Modem Model
To obtain the cellular modem model name:
: ```mmcli -m 0 | grep -a "model"```

### Modem model name
To obtain the Modem International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI):
: ```mmcli -m 0 | grep -a "imei"```

### Modem Carrier Information
To obtain the modem carrier information:
: ```mmcli -m 0 | grep -a "operator name"```

### Modem Signal Quality (%)
To obtain the modem signal quality:
: ```mmcli -m 0 | grep -a 'signal quality'```

### Enable Cell Modem:
For stations running FunCubes or other 166MHz radios, you may need to disable the modem module for the radios to work properly.

To enable the cell modem:
: ```/bin/bash /lib/ctt/sensor-station-software/system/scripts/enable-modem.sh```

### Disable Cell Modem:
To disable the cell modem:
: ```/bin/bash /lib/ctt/sensor-station-software/system/scripts/disable-modem.sh```

## System
### Update 434 MHz Radios to current firmware
To update the 434 MHz radios:
: ```sudo program-radios /lib/ctt/sensor-station-software/system/radios/fw/ss_v4.0.0.hex```

### Station ID
To obtain the station ID:
: ``` cat /etc/ctt/station-id```

### Station Image
To obtain the station image version:
: ```cat /etc/ctt/station-image```

### Real Time Clock (RTC) Time
To obtain the station time based on the RTC:
: ```sudo hwclock -r```

### Restart
To restart the station:
: ```sudo reboot```

### Bash Update Station
To update the station with a bash script:
: ```bash bash-update-station```

### Hostname
To obtain the station hostname
: ```hostname```

### Memory (RAM)
To display the total, used, and free memory: 
: ```free -h```

### Disk Space
To display the disk space usage:
: ```df -h```

### Uptime
To display how long the station has been running:
: ```uptime```

### Ping
To ping the station server:
: ```ping 8.8.8.8```

## Run the LCD commands from the Terminal

If your LCD screen is not working properly, you can still access most of the information displayed by the LCD screen by accessing the station hardware server from the terminal window. First, change the working director to:
: ```cd /lib/ctt/sensor-station-software```

Then, run the following line of code:
: ```npm run lcd-option command```

Replace the word command with one of the words from the list below. For example, if you want to get the battery and solar voltages from your Sensor Station, run:

```npm run lcd-option voltage```

and you will get a JSON object with the respective voltages:

```json
{
   "battery" : "11.61",
   "rtc" : -1,
   "solar" : "0.10"
}
```
