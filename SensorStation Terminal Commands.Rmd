# Terminal commands

If you are able to SSH into your Sensor Station (either over the internet or through a point-to-point connection), you can run these commands in your Mac or Linux terminal (or in GitBash, WSL in Windows).

## IP Address

Find your station's IP (internet protocol) address

```ifconfig```

If you are connected to the internet through WiFi, your IP address will be under the wlan0 field.

 ```wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
 inet 10.1.11.53  netmask 255.255.254.0  broadcast 10.1.11.255```

If you are connected through ethernet, you IP address will be under the eth0 field.
