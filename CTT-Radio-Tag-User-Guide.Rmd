## Using This Guide

Use the `Quick Start Guide` in the next section to get you up and running with your `Radio Tags`. For more detailed information you can proceed to the sections below the `Quick Start Guide`. Please provide any feedback via our `Customer Service Desk` portal [here](https://celltracktech.com/support-customer-service-desk/).

# LifeTag QuickStart Guide

What you will need:

* Either a `CTT Locator` or an operational `SensorStation` and a way to connect to it, either via ethernet or wirelessly.

1. Unpack your LifeTag. Note that your LifeTag ships with an 8-digit digital ID sticker. 

2. Record the unique digital IDs for each of your tags.

3. Place your `LifeTag`, solar panel facing up, in a location where it can get some direct light and within detection range of your `SensorStation` (*note: if not using antennas on your SensorStation, make sure nodes are within a meter of the station*) or `CTT Locator`.

3. Connect your computer to your SensorStation so you can view the web interface (*for SensorStation operation consult the online install guide [here](https://cellular-tracking-technologies.github.io/ctt_documentation/v2-SensorStation-User-Guide.html#connecting-to-your-sensorstation-web-interface))*.

4. Ensure your SensorStation has at least one radio tuned to detect `Tags` (*if this isn't clear, consult the SensorStation online install guide*).
