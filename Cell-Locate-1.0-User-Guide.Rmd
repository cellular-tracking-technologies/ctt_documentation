# Overview 

The CTT Cell-Locate transmitter is the first of its kind to use the global cell network as a means of data transmission and for estimating the location of your tagged animal. In doing so we have reduced the weight of the fully-functional unit to nearly 3 grams and with a programming scheme that can allow over a year's worth of transmissions on a single charge of the battery. Since each device also has a solar panel, any amount of light will extend the life and performance of your Cell Locate device.


# How it Works

The device's location is determined by first collecting information about one or more cell towers in the communication range. This information is then immediately transmitted to our data servers using the LTE-M1 cellular network. Finally, our servers generate a location estimate from our extensive tower database. The accuracy of cellular localization is ultimately determined by the geometry of the antenna coverage areas. Some coverage areas will be much smaller, leading to improved accuracy. We provide an uncertainty value with each location, which approximates the size of the coverage area.

Each cell tower can have multiple highly directional antennas that provide coverage for specific regions around the tower. The geometry of these regions is dependent on many factors such as antenna height relative to ground, antenna type, population density, and obstructions (trees, mountains, buildings .. etc). At the time of antenna installation, a fixed location (representative of the antenna region) is paired with the antenna. Our device interrogates the tower for its unique identifier and antenna, then our servers look up the area location from the tower parameters.

An example of the above description can be found in the following figure: The actual location of the device is represented as an American Robin. The cell tower can be found in the center of the multi-colored hexagon. Each of the three quadrilaterals within the hexagon are hypothetical coverage areas of three antennas belonging to the same tower. If the robin falls within one of the areas, the fixed location will be reported as the device's location. From the figure below, the robin fell in the “upper” area (quadrilateral "B"), so the location reported will correspond to the red marker.
