# Overview 

The CTT Cell-Locate transmitter is the first of its kind do use the global cell network not only as a means of data transmission but also for estimating the location of your tagged animal. In doing so we have reduced the weight of the fully-functional unit to nearly 3 grams, and with a programming scheme that can allow over a year's worth of transmissions on a single charge of the battery. Since each devices also has a solar panel, any amount of light will extend the life and performance of your Cell Locate device.
