## Introduction

The CTT Node™ is a mini-base-station that allows you to localize LifeTags™, PowerTags™ and HybridTags™ with a high degree of accuracy. If deployed in a grid fashion, and employing post-hoc analysis, the CTT Nodes can operate as pseudo-reverse-GPS, providing near GPS accuracy in optimal conditions. With the addition of calibration data, Nodes can provide presence/absence and distance estimate of instantaneous detections from supported tags.

The CTT Node uploads received tag detection data to the standard CTT SensorStation™, creating a dense, high resolution tracking network. Solar power recharges batteries in the CTT Nodes meaning no extra power cables or external solar systems are necessary.

Each CTT Node has a detectable range of about 250-300 meters, and is able to relay data to a CTT Base Station as far away as several kilometers.

## LED Pulse Patterns

| LED Pattern | Meaning|
|-------------|--------|
|10 seconds | Device boot up or reboot |
|Fading in 5 times | Device was commanded to enter Coverage Area Testing Mode with button press at boot|
|Flashing 3 times (100ms) | Occurs during bootup and indicates a custom configuration was loaded from EEPROM memory|
|Single flash (100ms) | Occurs during bootup and indicates default configuration is loaded|
|Flashing goes from fast to slow | Radio configuration problem|
|Flashing goes from slow to fast | Frequency provisioning error|
|Slow flash (5x at 500ms) | Maximum transmission retries, SensorStation did not acknowledge |
|2 flashes at 100ms | Message confirmed from SensorStation|
