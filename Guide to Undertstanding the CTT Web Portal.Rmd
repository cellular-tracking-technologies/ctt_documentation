## Configuration Tab

From the configuration tab you can see both the current configuration loaded on your unit, and the assignment history.

## Current Assignment Sub-tab

This panel shows the **latest configuration** running on the unit **since the last check-in**. <u>**This is important, because newly assigned configs will not update until the check-in following the one where the unit took the config.**</u>
