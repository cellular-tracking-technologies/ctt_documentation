# Introduction

Congratulations on your purchase of the new CTT Node V3! The CTT Internet of Wildlife System, which the Node has been an integral part of since the beginning, has just gotten a whole lot more awesome with this new Node. We took your suggestions to heart in developing this new Node, which has a few very specific benefits and departures from the old model:

1. Fully configurable through our robust CTT Mobile App
2. Separate solar-rechargeable power supply to allow for flexible grid setup and ability to add alternate power sources in the future
3. Fully accessible housing, for easy removal of the SD card and for inspection of the lEDs
4. Dual-mode compatibility with both 434MHz and 2.4GHz tags


# Node Quick Start Guide

We have no doubt that you are excited to deploy your Nodes, so here's a quick start guide to get you going in a few minutes.

## Connect your power source to your Node via the provided cable. 

![*How to connect the Node V3 to power supply*](/Users/davidlapuma/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/NodeV3_howToConnect.png){#id .class width=50%}

The power cable runs first through the `cap` of the `cable gland`, then the `rubber grommet` with the lip of the `grommet` facing toward the `Node` (see red arrow in the image below)

![*note that the grommet goes toward the Node with the lip facing toward the node, and flat end (see next pic) away from the Node*](/Users/davidlapuma/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/CTT_Git/ctt_documentation/images/NodeV3_grommet lip.png){#id .class width=50%}

When you screw the `cable gland cap` onto the `cable gland`, it will compress the `grommet` and seal around the cable. Before tightening, make sure the power plug is pulled through the cable gland and into the case, and plugged into the `5v barrel jack` on the Node board. Ensure a little bit of slack on the cable inside the case and then tighten down the cable gland cap until there is no movement in the cable when tugged lightly. This process both seals the entry from water, and helps reduce the chance of unintentionally pulling on the powe cable and damaging the board.

We recommend the final tightening of the cap with a crescent wrench.

Once the cap is tightened, you should see the grommet compressed around the cable.

## Mount your node for deployment

Your Node comes with the hardware necessary to mount it to a piece of 3/4" conduit. Note other mounting hardware is absolutley possible so feel free to use whatever makes sense for your site. In your shipment you have:

1. Node V3 mounted in a weatherproof case
2. Two (2) omni antennas - one tuned to 434MHz and the other tuned to 2.4GHz
3. Two (2) mounting shields, one for the top of the node, with three screw holes and no words printed on it, and one for the bottom of the node with the CTT logo printed on it. These mount to the node via the two corner holes on the shields and the four holes on the back of the node.

## A note about solar recharging

## Distance between Nodes and SensorStation

We recommend that all Nodes are placed within 1km of a SensorStation to ensure that all data is effectively transferred from the Nodes to the SensorStation. This assumes good line-of-sight between the Nodes and the SensorStation, so every installation must consider topography, vegetation, or height of Nodes and/or SensorStation antennas when estimating detection distance. Some trial and error should be expected when setting up your Node grid. 

## Distance between Nodes

Nodes can be used for various reasons to answer a number of questions. This section assumes that Nodes are being used for localization, or estimating a location within a Node grid from multiple simultaneous Node detections. In this case it's important to understand the relationship between distance and signal strength between your tags and your grid of nodes. This can be accomplished using one of your tags and a CTT Sidekick. We will go over this is a separate section, but assuming you have a good handle on at what distance signal strength becomes uninformative, with regards to distance, you will want to ensure that your node spacing is less than this distance. In several empirical cases we have found that distance to be ~150m, so spacing nodes every 100m or less is good for a number of bird species. For species that spend their life on the ground (turtles, etc.) this distance may be closer to 50m, but ultimately will require some test data collection.
